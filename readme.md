<h1>Refr!</h1>
<h3>What is refR?</h3>
This is a chrome extension that eliminates the need for scrolling up to refer to a figure or paragraph while reading something. Add this extension to your chrome browser and make reading articles on the web easier. Select the text/image that you want to refer and click on "refR this!". The text/image that you wanted to refer will be added to a pane on the right side of the webpage. This pane can be toggled open and close using the refR button on the browser toolbar.

<h3>How to install?</h3>
1. Clone the repository to anywhere on your system. <br>
2. Open chrome and goto "More tools > Extensions". <br>
3. Choose the "Load Unpacked" option on the toolbar above. <br>
4. Navigate to the folder where you've cloned the repo and click select. <br>
5. The extension is now added. <br>

<h3>How to use?</h3>
Simply select the text you'd like to refer and click on "refR this!". A side pane will be opened where the text is seen. Same can be done for an image. 
<br>
<h4>Note:</h4> 
<p>This mode of refering will work for any "selectable" text/image on anything opened using a browser (not necessarily webpage). </p>

<h3>Why does previous data remain?</h3>
The text/image that was refererd previously will be listed in the refR pane even after re-opening the browser. This is because the data is stored in the local storage of the browser.</p>

Have fun reading!
